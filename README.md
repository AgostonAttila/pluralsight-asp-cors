Learn how to configure CORS for your APIs to secure your web applications by making sure only authorized client applications can consume them, adding an extra layer of security.

In this modern application era, applications that have the client and the server on the same origin are becoming less and less common. APIs are accessed from multiple clients hosted on different origins. In this course, Configuring CORS in ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core, you will learn how to setup CORS for your APIs so only approved client applications can access them. First, you will learn how browsers implement CORS. Next, you will discover how to configure your ASP.NET applications to allow CORS request to origins that you trust. Finally, you will explore the different CORS requests types and configuration options to help us secure and optimize requests coming in from other origins. By the end of this course, you will be able to identify CORS requests, configure CORS for your ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core applications.
